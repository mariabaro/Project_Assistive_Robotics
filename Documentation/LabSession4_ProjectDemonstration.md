## ROBOTICS AND CONTROL OF BIOMEDICAL SYSTEMS
### Robotic arm Universal Robot UR5e
### Laboratory session 4: UR5e Social/Assistive robotic demonstration

---

The main objective of this laboratory session is to demonstrate the real-time execution of the assistive robotic tasks designed in the previous session using the UR5e robotic arm.

We can give you an exemple of a Social-Assistive task, such as a hand-shake or a give-me 5! task, which you can adapt to your own designed task.

**Laboratory development**

Each Laboratory group has up to 10 minutes project presentation with:
- Project presentation: with some slides summarising what you have learned and what you have done in this project
- Software and Hardware live demonstration of the assistive robotic tasks designed in the previous session. 
- All the students have to contribute to the final presentation
